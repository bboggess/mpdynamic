# mpdynamic
A dynamic playlist creator for MPD, essentially a better shuffle mode. Uses the Spotify API to dynamically add tracks to the main playlist based on what you are currently playing.

This project is currently the result of a weekend of hacking, and is by no means a complete piece of software.

Dependencies: mpd2 and spotipy python packages
